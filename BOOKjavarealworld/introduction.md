# Introduction

*"So are you planning on moving me into a developer role?"*

*"Yeah, I think so."*

Thus began my career as a Java developer. I soon found myself in possession of a buggy, poorly-written ETL application which relied on a framework that was deprecated when I was still in high school, and had no tests to boot. Naively, I assumed that since I had been studying Java for about a year, adding tests would just be a matter of careful refactoring. But what were all these XML files doing? How did the SQL in a separate file work its way into a `DAO` and a `DAOImpl`? Why did the application have build scripts for both Ant and Maven? (Never figured that one out.) What even *are* Ant and Maven? I eventually fumbled my way through these problems, using a combination of Google, the senior developers' expertise, and experimentation, yet I still am frustrated by the amount of culture shock I felt seeing my first real Java application.

Years later, I had been promoted to Senior Developer and our team decided to bring on a new Junior Developer. He was maybe a year out of college and had one previous job working mostly with JavaScript. But he had learned Java in college and showed real talent. Indeed his senior capstone project was writing a 3D graphics renderer in C++ from scratch. On his first real day, I showed him the small web app he would be working on, and started walking him through the project. It didn't take long for me to realize his understanding of Java (like mine a few years prior) stopped at the language itself. Maven, MyBatis, and Tomcat were just nonsense words.

It was easy for me to chalk up my lack of knowledge to not having a formal computer science education. But here was someone who went to school to learn how to program and was still stumped. Our wildly different educational paths left us equally unqualified. It turns out most Java education stops at the standard library. I chose to write this book because I wish it had existed when I was starting my career. I hope that it may be of some help to you as you begin your Java career. Happy coding!
